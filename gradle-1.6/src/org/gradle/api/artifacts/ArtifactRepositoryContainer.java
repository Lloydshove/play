/**
 * <p>A {@code ResolverContainer} is responsible for managing a set of {@link ArtifactRepository} instances. Repositories are arranged in a sequence.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can obtain a {@code ResolverContainer} instance by calling {@link org.gradle.api.Project#getRepositories()} or
 * using the {@code repositories} property in your build script.</p>
 *
 * <p>The resolvers in a container are accessible as read-only properties of the container, using the name of the
 * resolver as the property name. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * resolvers.addLast(name: 'myResolver')
 * resolvers.myResolver.url = 'some-url'
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A dynamic method is added for each resolver which takes a configuration closure. This is equivalent to calling
 * {@link #getByName(String, groovy.lang.Closure)}. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * resolvers.addLast(name: 'myResolver')
 * resolvers.myResolver {
 *     url 'some-url'
 * }
 * </pre>
